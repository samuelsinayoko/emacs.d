* Description
This is a elisp library for websocket clients to talk to websocket
servers. This library is designed to be used by other library writers,
to write apps that use websockets, and is not useful by itself.

An example of how to use the library is in the
[[https://github.com/ahyatt/emacs-websocket/blob/master/websocket-functional-test.el][websocket-functional-test.el]] file.

Currently, this library only supports unencrypted websockets.

* Version

This version should be usable, but should have the following
requirements for a version 1.0:

- Support for encrypted sockets.
- 3 clients using this module.  Without this many clients, it's hard
  to be sure the API is right, or there isn't a hidden bug in the
  module.

* Existing clients:

- [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-ipython-notebook][Emacs IPython Notebook]]

If you are using this module for your own emacs package, please let me
by editing this file, adding your project, and sending a pull request
to this repository.
