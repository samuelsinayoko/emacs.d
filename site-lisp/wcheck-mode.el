;;; Commentary:
;;
;; General interface for text checkers
;;
;; Wcheck is a minor mode for automatically checking and marking strings
;; in Emacs buffer. Wcheck sends (parts of) buffer's content to a
;; text-checker back-end and, based on its output, decides if some parts
;; of text should be marked.
;;
;; Wcheck can be used with external spell-checker programs such as
;; Ispell, Aspell and Enchant, but actually any tool that can receive
;; text stream from standard input and send text to standard output can
;; be used. The checker back-end can also be an Emacs Lisp function.

  "Language configuration for `wcheck-mode'.

Elements of this alist are of the form:

    (LANGUAGE (KEY . VALUE) [(KEY . VALUE) ...])

LANGUAGE is a name string for a language and KEY and VALUE pairs
denote settings for the language. Here is a description of
possible KEYs:

program
    VALUE can be a string or a function. If VALUE is a string, it
    must be the name of the external executable program which is
    responsible for text-checking LANGUAGE. Communication with
    the external program is managed through standard input and
    output streams.

    `wcheck-mode' collects text strings from the buffer and sends
    them (each on a separate line) to the external program for
    analyzing. The program must output (on separate lines) only
    the strings which it thinks should be marked in the Emacs
    buffer. Usually the reason is that the word is misspelled.
    The program should output nothing if it doesn't think that
    the string should be marked in Emacs buffer.

    VALUE can also be an Emacs Lisp function (a symbol or a
    lambda). Then that function is used as the text checker. The
    function is called with one argument: a list of strings
    collected from the buffer. The function is supposed to check
    them and return a list of strings (or nil). The returned
    strings will be marked in the buffer.

    See options `regexp-start', `regexp-body' and `regexp-end'
    below for details on how text is collected from the buffer.

args
    Optional command-line arguments for the program. The VALUE is
    a list of strings. Each string is a single argument for the
    program. (This option is ignored when the program is a
    function.)

connection
    The VALUE is used to set variable `process-connection-type'
    when starting the process for LANGUAGE. If the VALUE is nil
    use a pipe for communication; if it's `pty' (or t) use a PTY.
    The default is to use a pipe (nil). (This option is ignored
    when the program is a function.)

face
    A symbol referring to the face which is used to mark text with
    this LANGUAGE. The default is `wcheck-default-face'.

syntax
    VALUE is a symbol referring to an Emacs syntax table. This
    will be the effective syntax table that is used with regular
    expressions. See the Info node `(elisp)Syntax Tables' for
    more information. The default value is
    `text-mode-syntax-table'.

regexp-start
regexp-body
regexp-end
    Regular expression strings which match the start of a string
    body, characters within the body and the end of the body,
    respectively.

    This is how they are used in practice: `wcheck-mode' scans
    buffer's content and looks for strings that match the
    construct `regexp-start + regexp-body + regexp-end'. Strings
    that match regexp-body (but not `regexp-discard', see below)
    are sent to the text checker program or function to analyze.

    Strings returned from the program or function are marked in
    Emacs buffer using the following construction: `regexp-start
    + (regexp-quote STRING) + regexp-end'. The middle part is
    marked with `face' (see above) .

    Do not use grouping constructs `\\( ... \\)' in the regular
    expressions because the back reference `\\1' is used for
    separating the body string from the start and end match. You
    can use \"shy\" groups `\\(?: ... \\)' which do not record
    the matched substring.

    The default values for the regular expressions are

        \\=\\<'*         (regexp-start)
        \\w+?         (regexp-body)
        '*\\=\\>         (regexp-end)

    Effectively they match a series of word characters defined in
    the effective syntax table. Single quotes (') at the start
    and end of a word are excluded. This is probably a good thing
    when using `wcheck-mode' as a spelling checker.

regexp-discard
    The string that matched `regexp-body' is then matched against
    the value of this option. If this regular expression matches,
    then the string is discarded and won't be sent to the
    text-checker program or function to analyze. You can use this
    to define exceptions to the regexp-body match. The default
    value is

        \\`'+\\'

    which discards the body string if it consists only of single
    quotes. This was chosen as the default because the default
    syntax table `text-mode-syntax-table' defines single quote as
    a word character. It's probably not useful to mark individual
    single quotes in a buffer when `wcheck-mode' is used as a
    spelling checker.

    If you don't want to have any discarding rules set this
    option to empty string.

case-fold
    This boolean value is used to set value for variable
    `case-fold-search' for LANGUAGE. Similarly to
    `case-fold-search' the nil value means case-sensitive and a
    non-nil means case-insensitive search. The default is
    case-sensitive (nil). Note that this only has effect on
    `wcheck-mode's internal regular expression search.

suggestion-program
suggestion-args
    `suggestion-program' is either name (a string) of an external
    executable program or an Emacs Lisp function (a symbol or a
    lambda). When it's the name of an executable program then
    `suggestion-args' are the command-line arguments (a list of
    strings) for the program.

    When user clicks the right mouse button on marked text, or
    executes command `wcheck-spelling-suggestions', the marked
    text will be sent to the `suggestion-program' as standard
    input stream. The program should send suggested
    substitutes (in one way or another) to the standard output
    stream. The output is parsed with `suggestion-parser'
    function (see below).

    When `suggestion-program' is an Emacs Lisp function the
    function is called with one argument: the marked text (a
    string) which user wants spelling suggestions for. The
    function must return all substitute suggestions as a list of
    strings or nil if there are no suggestions.

suggestion-parser
    VALUE of this option is an Emacs Lisp function which is
    responsible for parsing the output of `suggestion-program'.
    This parser function is only used when `suggestion-program'
    is an external executable program (not a function).

    The parser function is run without arguments and within the
    context of a temporary buffer. The buffer contains all the
    output from the external program and the point is located at
    the beginning of the buffer. `suggestion-parser' function
    should collect all the substitute suggestions from the buffer
    and return them as a list of strings or nil if there are no
    suggestions.

    For the most common cases there are three parser functions
    already implemented:

        `wcheck-parse-suggestions-ispell' parses substitute
        suggestions from the output of Ispell or compatible
        program, such as Enchant or Aspell. Use this function as
        the `suggestion-parser' if you get suggestions from an
        Ispell-like program with its \"-a\" command-line option.

        `wcheck-parse-suggestions-lines' function turns each line
        in the output of `suggestion-program' to individual
        substitute suggestions.

        `wcheck-parse-suggestions-ws'. Each whitespace-separated
        token in the program's output is a separate suggestion.

read-or-skip-faces
    This option controls which faces `wcheck-mode' should read or
    skip when scanning buffer's content. The value must be a list
    and its items are also lists:

        (MAJOR-MODE [OPERATION-MODE [FACE ...]])

    MAJOR-MODE is a symbol or a list of symbols. Symbols refer to
    the major mode(s) which the settings are for. Use nil as the
    MAJOR-MODE to define default settings. Settings that come
    after the pseudo major-mode nil are ignored.

    OPERATION-MODE is symbol `read' or `skip' defining whether
    the FACEs should be read or skipped. If it's `read' then only
    the listed faces are read. If it's `skip' then the listed
    faces are skipped and all other faces are read. If
    OPERATION-MODE is nil or it doesn't exist at all then
    everything is read.

    The rest of the items are FACEs. They are typically symbols
    but some Emacs modes may use strings, property lists or cons
    cells for defining faces. For more information see Info
    node `(elisp) Special Properties'. Use nil as the face to
    refer to the normal text which does not have a face text
    property.

    Example:

        (read-or-skip-faces
         ((emacs-lisp-mode c-mode) read
          font-lock-comment-face font-lock-doc-face)
         (org-mode skip font-lock-comment-face org-link)
         (text-mode)
         (nil read nil))

    It says that in `emacs-lisp-mode' and `c-mode' only the text
    which have been highlighted with `font-lock-comment-face' or
    `font-lock-doc-face' is read (i.e., checked). In `org-mode'
    faces `font-lock-comment-face' and `org-link' are
    skipped (i.e., not checked) and all other faces are read. In
    `text-mode' everything is read. Finally, in all other major
    modes only the normal text (nil) is read.

    The global default is equivalent to

        (read-or-skip-faces
         (nil))

    which means that in all major modes read everything. It is
    sometimes useful to have this setting in language-specific
    options too because the parsing stops right there. Therefore
    it overrides all global settings which user may have
    configured with variable `wcheck-language-data-defaults'.

    Note: You can use command `\\[what-cursor-position]' with a
    prefix argument to see what faces are active at the cursor
    position. Then you can use the information to configure this
    option.

Here's an example value for the `wcheck-language-data' variable:

    ((\"Finnish\"
      (program . \"/usr/bin/enchant\")
      (args  \"-l\" \"-d\" \"fi\")
      (syntax . my-finnish-syntax-table)
      (suggestion-program . \"/usr/bin/enchant\")
      (suggestion-args \"-a\" \"-d\" \"fi\")
      (suggestion-parser . wcheck-parse-suggestions-ispell))
     (\"British English\"
      (program . \"/usr/bin/ispell\")
      (args \"-l\" \"-d\" \"british\")
      (suggestion-program . \"/usr/bin/ispell\")
      (suggestion-args \"-a\" \"-d\" \"british\")
      (suggestion-parser . wcheck-parse-suggestions-ispell))
     (\"Trailing whitespace\"
      (program . identity)
      (suggestion-program . (lambda (string) (list \"\")))
      (face . highlight)
      (regexp-start . \"\")
      (regexp-body . \"[ \\t]+\")
      (regexp-end . \"$\")
      (regexp-discard . \"\")
      (read-or-skip-faces)
       (nil))
     (\"Highlight FIXMEs\"
      (program . (lambda (strings)
                   (when (member \"FIXME\" strings)
                     (list \"FIXME\"))))
      (face . highlight)
      (read-or-skip-faces
       ((emacs-lisp-mode c-mode) read font-lock-comment-face)
       (nil))))

You can use variable `wcheck-language-data-defaults' to define
default values for all these options. The defaults are used when
language-specific option does not exist or is not valid."

Normally the global value defines the language for new buffers.
If a buffer-local value exists it is used instead. This variable
becomes automatically buffer-local when `wcheck-mode' is turned
on in a buffer, so changing the global value does not affect
buffers which already have `wcheck-mode' turned on.

User is free to set this variable directly (e.g., in programs)
but in interactive use it is usually better to use the command
`\\[wcheck-change-language]' instead. The command can change
language immediately while `wcheck-mode' is turned on, whereas
changing just the value of this variable takes effect only when
`wcheck-mode' is turned on next time."

(define-minor-mode wcheck-mode
  "General interface for text checkers.

With optional (prefix) ARG turn on the mode if ARG is positive,
otherwise turn it off. If ARG is not given toggle the mode.

Wcheck is a minor mode for automatically checking and marking
strings in Emacs buffer. Wcheck sends (parts of) buffer's content
to a text-checker back-end and, based on its output, decides if
some parts of text should be marked.

Wcheck can be used with external spell-checker programs such as
Ispell, Aspell and Enchant, but actually any tool that can
receive text stream from standard input and send text to standard
output can be used. The checker back-end can also be an Emacs
Lisp function.

In Wcheck mode different configuration units are called
\"languages\". See the documentation of variables
`wcheck-language-data', `wcheck-language-data-defaults' and
`wcheck-language' for information on how to configure Wcheck
mode. You can access the variables through customize group
`wcheck'.

Interactive command `wcheck-change-language' is used to switch
languages. Command `wcheck-spelling-suggestions' gives spelling
suggestions for marked text at point (also accessible through the
right-click mouse menu). Commands `wcheck-jump-forward' and
`wcheck-jump-backward' move point to next/previous marked text
area."
